\arguments{
\item{neurons}{first set of neurons}

\item{targets}{second set of neurons}

\item{neuropil}{an as3d object of the neuropil in which to consider connectivity. Defaults to whole brain.}

\item{delta}{the distance (in um) at which a synapse might occur}

\item{split}{with a CATMAID neuron, whether or not to split the neuron using flow centrality}

\item{rval}{whether to return an overlap score matrix or a neuronlist in which every point is given an overlap score against each of the target neurons}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to methods}
}
\value{
a matrix of 3D points
}
\description{
Generates an 'overlap matrix' of overlap scores between neurons in the 'neurons' and 'targets' pools.
For every point in a given neuron in 'neurons', a distance score is calculated to every point in a neuron in 'targets'.
The sum of this score is added to the final output matrix. The score is calculated as e(-d^2/2δ^2), where d is the euclidean distance between the two points,
and δ is the expected distance in um that is considered 'close'.
